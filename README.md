What BMI means?
  - Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.
  - A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.
  - The higher your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing problems, and certain cancers.
NOTES: BMI over 35 doesn't mean that you are obese. Like some pro athlete have BMI over 35 but they are very healthy, BMI only for normal people and not for pro athlete.
